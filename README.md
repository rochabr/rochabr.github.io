### Enrich your location data with Azure Maps | Microsoft

Location information can be very simple or very detailed. For a person delivering a package to certain house, an address with street number, name, city, and state could be more than enough information for them to find the right place.

Adding the latitude and longitude of the vehicle to present its current and historical positions is more important.

### AWS AMER Summit Aug 2021: Build secure, location-based applications on AWS

Organizations are building location-based applications across myriad use cases, from geomarketing to asset tracking and delivery. For example, a fire department may build an application to make it safer for volunteers using geofences, or muster points, to establish a designated safety zone in distress situations. Amazon Location Service and AWS Amplify can help you build secure, production-ready applications with location functionality, faster. In this session, dive into common use cases for location-based applications and learn how to build an application with geofences and asset tracking. In addition, learn how to create a geofence, securely track devices within that geofence, and deliver a secure, location-based application at scale.
